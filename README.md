# 🌱 Smart Greenhouse with Web Server 🌍  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **real-time, implementable smart greenhouse** that leverages **IoT technologies**. The system monitors and controls environmental conditions using **ESP32, ESP-NOW, MQTT, and cloud integration**. A **web server** is implemented to provide real-time monitoring and control.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **Real-time Environmental Monitoring** – Tracks temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and more.  
- ✅ **ESP32 with ESP-NOW & MQTT** – Wireless data transmission between nodes.  
- ✅ **Cloud Data Storage** – Captured data is uploaded for remote access.  
- ✅ **Automated Control** – Adjusts greenhouse conditions based on sensor readings.  
- ✅ **Web Dashboard** – User-friendly interface for real-time monitoring & control.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- 🔹 **Hardware:** ESP32, Sensors (DHT11/DHT22, Soil Moisture, etc.)  
- 🔹 **Communication:** ESP-NOW, MQTT  
- 🔹 **Web Server:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask/Django (optional)  
- 🔹 **Cloud:** Firebase / AWS / Google Cloud (TBD)  

## 🔗 Future Enhancements  
- 💡 **AI-based Predictive Analysis** – Optimize plant growth using AI models.  
- 💡 **Mobile App Integration** – Remote monitoring and control via mobile.  
- 💡 **Solar-Powered Automation** – Sustainable energy solutions for greenhouse operations.
